<h1>What Can I Do?</h1>
<p>You can write a document!  You can do math!  You can do both at once!</p>
<ul>
<li>To write a document, either:
<ul><li>Click on a letter in the virtual keyboard.</li>
<li>Select the row and column by using the <code>[]</code> keys.</li>
  <ol><li>Press the <code>]</code> (close square bracket) key until the correct row is highlighted.</li>
  <li>Press the <code>[</code> (open square bracket) key to select the row.</li>
  <li>Press the <code>]</code> (close square bracket) key until the correct letter or symbol is highlighted.</li>
  <li>Press the <code>[</code> (open square bracket) key to select the letter or symbol.</li>
  <li>You may use the <code>\</code> (backslash) key to select the suggested completion.</li>
</ol>
<li>Type the letter on the normal computer keyboard.</li></ul>
It will show up in the document at right, just as if someone typed it on the normal computer keyboard.
</li>
<li>To do math:
<ol><li>Start typing a math problem using the virtual keyboard (or normal computer keyboard).</li>
<li>The answer will show up in the upper left corner of the virtual keyboard.</li>
<li>Either select it from the virtual keyboard as normal, or hit the <code>\</code> key.</li></ol>

<h1>Inspiration</h1>
<p>	Motor-disabled people are often unable to use a computer keyboard, which prevents them from accessing most computer functions.  However, they can often use simple buttons or joysticks with an onscreen "virtual keyboard."  In addition, learning-disabled people often need a simple typing program with word-completion to enable them to write much better.</p>
<p>  Most existing programs are executable files, which system administrators must install on each individual machine.  However - even aside from only working on a single computer - they have several problems.  For example, it is quite hard to switch between applications, and they have no embedded calculator.
</p>
<p>CalcuType is a simple Web-based text editor and calculator which works entirely inside the browser.  Therefore, it can run on any Internet-capable computer.  It has built-in <a href="about.html#typing">text editing</a>, <a href="about.html#math">mathematical equation solving</a>, and <a href="about.html#completion">word completion</a>.</p>
