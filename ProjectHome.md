# About #
This is an JavaScript project to create a browser-based switch-accessible writing and calculation tool for people with motor impairments.

# Using #
If you want to try it out on the web, go to http://gb-cs.cs.unc.edu/calcutype/.

If you're running Windows, you'll probably want to download the <tt>.zip</tt> version.  If you're running Linux, you'll probably want to download the <tt>.tar</tt> version.  I don't know what would be best if you're running Mac.

To try it on your local machine, download the current source version (at right), unzip it, and simply open index.html in your favorite browser.

Please fill out the survey form (listed with the downloads) to let us know what you think about CalcuType!  You can either fill it out and save it by using CalcuType itself or copy it into plain text.  If you'd rather email us, please email <gb@cs.unc.edu>.  Thank you!

# Developing #
If you want to help develop and improve CalcuType, we'd love your help.  Of course, we'd love any improvements.  However, if you don't know just what to do, here are some long-range goals we've been thinking about:
  * Add more functions to the calculator.
  * Make the word-completion list responsive to user input.
  * Enable CalcuType to import files from places like Google Docs.

# Updates #
Version 0.95 was posted 11 AM EST on 24 February 2009, replacing the previous version 0.85.  (The previous version can still be downloaded from the downloads page.)  New features in Version 0.95 include:
  * The calculator recognizes exponents!
  * The "process form" button on the option page is removed; you can now simply click on the link.
  * The calculator evaluates trig functions in degrees by default.  (You can still use radians by setting the appropriate button on the options page.)
  * The cursor is shown even when you're clicking on the virtual keyboard with the mouse.
  * The "advance one word" button now allows you to move to the end of the text.

As always, please let us know at gb@cs.unc.edu if you have any problems with the new version!
